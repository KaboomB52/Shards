### What is Shards?
Shards is a economy plugin I made over a few hours that uses a light redis database to store it's profile system, modeled after the "Raindrops" plugin on Overcast (oc.tc).

### How can I add this into my own plugins?
Shards has a very simple API for all functions within it's profiles like resetting, changing values, and more!

### How can I contribute to Shards?
Contributing to Shards is incredibly easy! All you need to do is create a fork of this project on your own GitHub account, commit something new to it and make a pull request. I'll then review the pull request and merge it into the main repository!
